## Abstract

%Despite the significant progress in tiny object tracking algorithms based on convolutional neural networks, the performance falls short of the ideal level due to dataset challenges like small scale, limited %scene diversity, low popularity of the competition, and low-resolution (720p) images. The lack of specialized large-scale tiny object tracking datasets leads current algorithms to rely on small and saturated %datasets from TrackNet. In this paper, We establish the first comprehensive and high-resolution badminton dataset, named Badminton100K. To our best knowledge, Badminton100K is the first badminton tracking %dataset to date that has a high resolution of 1080p. We provide over 100K annotations covering over 200 videos from 12 professional badminton championships. Our dataset covers various badminton events in a broad %and diverse background. To enhance the robustness and generalization of tracking algorithms, we also release a high-resolution tennis dataset, Tennis50K, with over 50,000 annotations, and a squash dataset, %Squash30K, with over 30,000 annotations. Moreover, considering the fast-moving tiny balls in videos often leads to challenges such as blur, afterimage, overlap, and disappearance. A strong baseline for tiny ball 5tracking is proposed, a novel cross-stage multi-scale fusion U-shape network (CMU-Net), which can extract local high-resolution details in shallow stages, capture global semantic information in deep stages, and %improve context representation through cross-stage and within-stage multi-scale feature fusion, enabling accurate identification and localization of tiny balls. Extensive experiments are conducted on the %proposed benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented state-of-the-art tracking performance on Badminton100K, and exhibits outstanding generalization and robustness on %Tennis50K and Squash30K.
